## Pokémon Card Game — README (Concise & Professional)

Brief: A focused React + Vite demo that renders responsive Pokémon cards using official artwork. Components are implemented with React class components and styled with modern CSS for a polished presentation.

Key Points

- Purpose: Portfolio/demo project showcasing component composition and simple API-driven UI.
- Status: Development-ready. Use `npm run dev` for local development with HMR.

Quick Start

1. Clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/veyseleminoglu/PokeGame_Clone.git
cd PokeGame_Clone
```

2. Install & run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Demo GIF (where to place)

- Add your animated preview to `public/demo.gif` (project `public/` folder).
- This README references the raw file so GitHub can load it directly:

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veyseleminoglu/PokeGame_Clone/main/public/demo.gif)

If the README preview does not animate on GitHub, open the raw URL in a new tab:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veyseleminoglu/PokeGame_Clone/main/public/demo.gif

Project Structure (essential)

```
public/               # static assets (place demo.gif here)
src/
  App.jsx
  main.jsx
  Pokecard.jsx
  Pokedex.jsx
  *.css
```

Notes

- Keep `public/demo.gif` under ~10MB for best compatibility.
- If GitHub still shows a static frame, external hosting (Imgur/Giphy) or GitHub Releases often preserves animation reliably.

If you want, I can also add a short one-line project blurb, license badge, or CI/build status badges.

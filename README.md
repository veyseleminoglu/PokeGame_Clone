# Pokémon Card Game — Project Overview

## Short description

A polished demo built with React and Vite that renders Pokémon cards using official artwork. Implemented with class components and clean CSS to showcase component structure, image loading, and visual styling.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/veyseleminoglu/PokeGame_Clone.git
cd PokeGame_Clone
```

2. Install & run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` (Vite may choose another port).

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Demo GIF (placement)

- Place an animated preview at `public/demo.gif` (project `public/` folder).
- This README links the raw file so GitHub can load it directly:

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veyseleminoglu/PokeGame_Clone/main/public/demo.gif)

If GitHub's preview shows a static frame for your browser, open the raw URL to play it:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veyseleminoglu/PokeGame_Clone/main/public/demo.gif

## Project highlights

- Reusable components: `Pokedex` (list) and `Pokecard` (item).
- Images sourced from the official PokéAPI sprites repository.
- Styled with responsive CSS and layered box-shadows for depth.

## Essential structure

```
public/               # static assets (put demo.gif here)
src/
  App.jsx
  main.jsx
  Pokecard.jsx
  Pokedex.jsx
  *.css
```

## Notes

- Keep `public/demo.gif` reasonably sized (under ~10MB) and moderate resolution for best preview performance.
- If you want guaranteed animation in the README, I can host the GIF externally (Imgur/Giphy) and update the link.
